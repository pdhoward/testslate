    content: `for the attached Cobol program using your interpretation skills, create an English translation of this code that explains what the overall purpose of the program is in a one statement executive summary that a non-technical person would understand. Also provide a summarized paragraph of the Cobol program’s functions within the program that a non-technical person would understand. And finally create a detailed step by step explanation of the steps necessary to successfully complete the program’s purpose that a non-technical person would understand. Also create user story for the program, including success criteria and give it a title.
Include all operations, including validations, done on each data element that will be persisted to some type of data store such as a file or database. Include element name, record name and data store name for each data element referenced. Filter the text to remove references to i/o types of processes such as open and close. Do not miss any persisted data elements in your detailed steps. So double check yourself.`
